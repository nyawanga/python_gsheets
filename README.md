# python_gsheets
A repo listing all scripts I create and use to interact with google sheets using python mainly through pygsheets

- app has the main scripts
- lib should ideally contain the db authentication credentials module
- files has json object that has google auths and the sql statements that you use to query your db

On the app foilder the scripts have a dictionary "worksheet" the keys need to be named exactly as the sql files that fetch data from the db
